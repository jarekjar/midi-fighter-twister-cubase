# Midi Fighter Twister Configuration for Cubase

This document provides instructions for configuring your Midi Fighter Twister using the Midi Fighter Utility software to work with the Cubase MIDI Remote script.

## Basic Setup

1. Download and install the Midi Fighter Utility from DJ TechTools website
2. Connect your Midi Fighter Twister to your computer
3. Open the Midi Fighter Utility
4. Create a new configuration or reset to default

## General Settings

- MIDI Channel: Channel 1 (default)
- Side button mode: Side buttons send CC messages

## Encoder Configuration

Configure all 16 encoders with the following settings:

### Encoders 0-15 (Main Encoders)
- Encoder MIDI Type: ENC 3FH/41H (Relative Binary Offset mode)
- CC Number: 0-15 (matching the encoder number)
- MIDI Channel: 1
- Has Detent: Enabled (for centered parameters like pan)
- Sensitivity: 5-7 (adjust to preference)
- Acceleration: Medium

### Encoder Buttons 0-15
- CC Number: 16-31 (16 + encoder number)
- MIDI Channel: 1
- Switch Type: Toggle
- LED Feedback: MIDI CC (to show on/off states)

### Left Side Buttons (0-2)
- CC Number: 32-34
- MIDI Channel: 1
- Switch Type: Toggle

### Right Side Buttons (0-2)
- CC Number: 35-37
- MIDI Channel: 1
- Switch Type: Toggle

## RGB LED Colors Setup

Configure RGB LEDs for visual feedback:

### Mixer Page (Bank 1)
- Encoders 0-7 (Volume): Blue
- Encoders 8-15 (Pan): Purple
- Set the RGB brightness to 5-7 (adjust to preference)

### EQ Page (Bank 2)
- Band 1 encoders (0,4,8,12): Red
- Band 2 encoders (1,5,9,13): Yellow
- Band 3 encoders (2,6,10,14): Green
- Band 4 encoders (3,7,11,15): Blue

### Plugin Page (Bank 3)
- All encoders: White

### Transport Page (Bank 4)
- Transport controls: Orange
- Zoom controls: Cyan

## Bank Configuration

The script uses Cubase's page system rather than the Twister's internal banks, but you can still set up the LED colors per bank to match the Cubase pages.

1. Configure Bank 1 with blue/purple colors (Mixer page)
2. Configure Bank 2 with red/yellow/green/blue colors (EQ page)
3. Configure Bank 3 with white color (Plugin page)
4. Configure Bank 4 with orange/cyan colors (Transport page)

## Important Notes

1. The Cubase script handles the switching between "pages" - the Midi Fighter Twister's internal banks are not used for this purpose. The right side buttons are mapped to change the active page in Cubase.

2. For encoder sensitivity, if parameters are changing too quickly or too slowly, adjust the Sensitivity and Acceleration settings in the Midi Fighter Utility.

3. If you're working with plugins that need finer control, consider adjusting the encoder sensitivity to a lower value.

4. Save your configuration in the Midi Fighter Utility with a meaningful name like "Cubase_MFT_Config".

5. Make sure your Midi Fighter Twister is properly connected and selected in Cubase's MIDI Remote setup.

## Troubleshooting

- If parameter feedback isn't working, ensure that "Send feedback to controller" is enabled in Cubase's MIDI Remote settings.

- If buttons don't toggle properly, check the switch type setting in the Midi Fighter Utility. They should be set to "Toggle" mode.

- If you encounter issues with relative encoder movement, make sure all encoders are set to "ENC 3FH/41H" mode in the Midi Fighter Utility.

- If Cubase doesn't detect your Midi Fighter Twister, check that it's properly connected and appearing in Cubase's MIDI ports list.
